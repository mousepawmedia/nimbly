Nimbly
========================================

**Nimble like a mouse.**

Nimbly provides performance-minded alternatives to many standard library
classes. It focuses on minimizing CPU usage first, and memory second,
while leaving you in control. Nimbly is designed to shine in low-resource
environments.

See the [official project page](https://mousepawmedia.com/nimbly).

> Nimbly was originally part of PawLIB.
